# wavecue
A simple python script which tries to read cue markers from a wav file. 

## Introduction
This is a command line script to extract cue markers from wav files. It would work with uncompressed wave files only as there is no variable bitrate chunk size  calculation. 

## Usage
* Just needs python3, no special modules
```
python3 wavecue.py <filename>
```
